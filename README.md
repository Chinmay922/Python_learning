# Python_programs

Practice python programs to get hands-on with python.

# Task 1

In a given array of integers, we need to find two numbers such that they can add up to a specific number.
We may assume there is exactly one solution, and we can’t use the same element twice. We also need to analyze the time complexity of the program 

# Task 2

Constructing a binary tree, and finding the maximum depth of the tree. Giving a custom binary tree to test it.

# Task 3

In two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers the digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Adding the two numbers and returning it as a linked list. We are assuming that the two numbers does not contain any leading zero except the number zero itself. Also designing a custom input to test the program

# Task 4

Given a string s, finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. We are assuming that the string length is less than 100, and it only contains English letters.

# Task 5

Writing a basic NumPy program to add, subtract, multiply, divide arguments element-wise.

# Task 6

Using OpenCV to do a bilateral filter to a given image and visualizing the images before and after the filtering using matplotlib.

# Task 7

Given a binary tree and a sum, determining if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. A leaf in this tree is a node with no children.

# Task 8

Using SciPy for an application of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and applying DFT to the array “a” and visualizing both original and result signals.

# Task 9

Given an integer array nums, finding the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and returning its sum.

# Task 10

Given an array of k linked-lists, where each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merging all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and returning it.

# Task 11

Making a NumPy program to get the values and indices of the elements that are bigger than 10 in a given array.

# Task 12

Using template matching with OpenCV to find Messi’s face in an image, try 6 different methods given in the program and plotting the result to understand the difference.
