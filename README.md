# Python_programs

Practice python programs to get hands-on with python.

# Task 1

In a given array of integers, we need to find two numbers such that they can add up to a specific number.
We may assume there is exactly one solution, and we canâ€™t use the same element twice. We also need to analyze the time complexity of the program 

# Task 2

Constructing a binary tree, and finding the maximum depth of the tree. Giving a custom binary tree to test it.

# Task 3

In two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers the digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Adding the two numbers and returning it as a linked list. We are assuming that the two numbers does not contain any leading zero except the number zero itself. Also designing a custom input to test the program

# Task 4

Given a string s, finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. We are assuming that the string length is less than 100, and it only contains English letters.

# Task 5

Writing a basic NumPy program to add, subtract, multiply, divide arguments element-wise.

# Task 6
